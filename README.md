# OnlineNewsAnalysis
Hello, my name is Cl√©ment LAJOUX, a student in Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence at ESILV engineering school
This is an analysis of the Online News dataset hosted on UCI.
# Project content
This project contains 4 main part :
- Part 1. Powerpoint introduction
- Part 2. A jupyter notebook containing the data analysis of the dataset
- Part 3. A jupyter notebook containing the creation of a predictive model
- Part 4. A flask API that can serve the model created previously + a client example to test the API

# Introduction
First, I highly recommend you to check out the PowerPoint introduction since it helps you understand what I've done and gives you a better understanding of the study context.

# Analysis and Model
The analysis helps you understand with plots the content of the dataset and its repartition. It is very useful to understand the model generation.

I didn't go too far on analysis because lots of the features were based on an NLP program so, it was not very intelligible. The dataset doesn't fit that much for plot analysis.

In the modelization notebook, I tried different models and there is a conclusion at the end with the comparison of all models, but the most successful model was a grid search tuned gradient boosting that achieves an accuracy of **68%**.

**Be careful** if you want to try executing the notebook, the grid-search step took me over **4 hours** to complete since I tried a large panel of parameters even on a powerful computer.

# API
 How to use the API ?
 Open a terminal and lauch the app<i></i>.py file

    C:> py app.py
Now that the server is listening you can execute the client (API_client_exemple.py) and it will print you the accuracy of the prediction for the first 4000 elements. This can be modify in the API_client_exemple.py
